            <h2>Meaty Timing</h2>

            <h3>SFV CHAMPION EDITION</h3>

            <p>
                Timing a meaty attack or a meaty throw on your opponent&#8217s wakeup consistently can be very difficult, especially if your opponent is mixing up their recovery options between quickrise and backroll (normal and back recovery). Before we actually get into different techniques to time our meaties, it&#8217s good to understand why it&#8217s so difficult in the first place and how the recovery options work.
            </p>

            <p>
                After a player is hit by a move that results in a soft knockdown, they end up flying in the air for some period of time that is different for every move. But once they finally touch the ground again, there are only three possible recoveries that can occur; all with consistent timings.
            </p>

            <p>
                After looking through all the character&#8217s quickrise and backroll animations, it takes 4-5 frames before there is a discernible difference between the animations. At best, you can differentiate them by the horizontal movement that occurs for the backroll. But at worst, you have to rely on the position of one of the characters body parts (legs or head); especially in the corner. Ibuki&#8217s recovery animations are notoriously difficult to react to, even if you know to watch for her legs.
            </p>

            <p>
                Assuming we want to hit our opponent before the 3rd frame of their quickrise wakeup, we need at least 24-25 frames of total reaction time (30F quickrise - 5F to differentiate - 1F to move before opponent = 25F). This is if we want to use the fastest normal in the game; a 3F jab. If we wanted to use a slower move, then we would have even less time to react.
            </p>

            <p>
                Because reaction times differ from person to person, how do you determine which move is best suited for you? The following test will show you how:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Go to training mode and choose Ryu as 1P and Karin as CPU.</li>
                <li>Set the dummy to guard After First Attack.</li>
                <li>Set the dummy to Randomly perform a Recovery when knocked down.</li>
                <li>Record the dummy to do a reversal backdash in Record Wakeup Actions.</li>
                <li>Set Wakeup Actions on.</li>
                <li>Move Karin into the left corner of the stage and stand point blank in front of her.</li>
                <li>Knock Karin down using Ryu&#8217s sweep (cr.HK). </li>
                <li>Anticipate that Karin will quickrise.</li>
                <li>If she does quickrise, react by pressing Ryu&#8217s st.LP (3F startup).</li>
                <li>If she backrolls, it&#8217s important that you do nothing.</li>
                <li>Success: Hit Karin without a Counter/Crush Counter popup appearing on the left side of your screen. She will stay grounded.</li>
                <li>Failure: Counter/Crush Counter popup appears or you press a button when she backrolls.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                In this test, you want to hit Karin successfully at least 9/10 times. Move down the list using a slower and slower move until you can no longer get at least 9/10 successful hits. It&#8217s perfectly fine to try this as many times as want to familiarize yourself with the scenario.  The corresponding reaction time shown in the table is your reliable single stimulus reaction time. Note that this number takes into account the input lag of the game and your peripherals. This also makes it very useful for figuring out other reactionary aspects of SFV, e.g. whiff punishing, hit confirms, interrupting slow moves.

            <p>
                Same button, different timing. This technique is probably the most intuitive and what most players will try initially. Here you anticipate that your opponent will quickrise. If they do quickrise, then you react immediately and press your button. However, if you see them backroll instead, then you end up delaying the time you press your button just enough to meaty your backrolling opponent. This technique relies on the fact that when we focus and anticipate for only a single stimulus, our reaction time is usually the fastest it can be. However, if something else unexpected comes up, then we hesitate and our reaction time for that unexpected stimuli is much slower. By taking advantage of this difference in reaction time (hopefully around 5 frames), we can time our meaty even if our opponent backrolls.
            </p>

            <p>
                This phenomena of reacting slower to an unexpected action has many ramifications, not only for meaty timing. You may have come across this when trying to anti-air a jumping opponent. If all your doing is watching the skies; anticipating that they&#8217ll jump soon, then when they actually do, you will usually have no problem reacting in time with an anti-air. However, if your mind and attention is focused elsewhere; perhaps reacting to a dash in or waiting for your opponent to whiff a move, then a jump in from your opponent will be much harder to react to. You might have to resort to blocking the jump in or maybe worse, react too slowly with an anti-air and get hit.
